# Course Project: Logic Circuit Design and Simulation

## Overview  
This project focuses on the design and simulation of basic logic gates and the implementation of logic functions using **Perfect Disjunctive Normal Form (PDNF)** and **Perfect Conjunctive Normal Form (PCNF)**. The work is based on digital logic principles and implemented using the VHDL hardware description language in the Quartus Prime development environment.

## Features  
- Implementation of basic logic gates: AND, OR, NOT  
- Development of logic functions in PDNF and PCNF forms  
- Use of structural and schematic modeling (BDF) in Quartus  
- Simulation of logic behavior using waveform files (VWF)  
- Organization of modular code with reusability and clarity

## Technologies Used  
- VHDL – for hardware description  
- Intel Quartus Prime – for synthesis, design entry, and simulation  
- BDF (Block Diagram Files) – for schematic logic design  
- VWF (Vector Waveform Files) – for functional simulation
